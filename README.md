## General Info
The code, here, is written in the course of working through the *leetcode problems*.
 
## Technologies Used
The code will be written in Typescript and tested using JestJS.

## Contents
### Arrays & Hashing 
#### Contains Duplicate
 Given an intger array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
##### Brute Force
##### Sort & Compare
##### Hashmap and Compare

#### Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
##### Brute Force
##### Map & Compute Differences

#### Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
##### Sort & Compare
##### Map & Compare 

#### Valid Anagram
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
##### Sort & Compare
##### Map & Compare
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
##### Sort & Compare
##### Map & Compare

#### Product Except Self
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
##### Compare 
##### Compare in Place

## Usage
The code from the various sections of the project will be largely executed through the testing of the code to ensure that a correct solution has been found.
```
   npm test
```
    
## Project Status
The project will be in an ongoing status until the code for each section is completed and the *leetcode problems* have been completed as well.
    
## Room for Improvement
Similarly to the above section of this document, there can be seen a general room for improvement as the greater project associated with this project is a learning project.
